# Installation Instructions and Documentation for the Adafruit TSL2591 Light Sensor
This file contains instructions on how to connect and run the Adafruit TSL2591 sensor for measuring light levels. For more information see this [webpage](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tsl2591/overview) on the sensor.

## Hardware Connection for the TSL2591
The SPS30 requires a connection for the 4 of the 5 pins on the sensor. From left to right, the pins correspond to:
1. **Vin**: Power pin
2. **GND**: Ground pin
3. **3vo**: Output voltage regulator
4. **INT**: INTerrupt pin from the sensor
5. **SDA**: I2C data pin
4. **SCL**: I2C clock pin

The acronyms are described in the image above. This document and setup is for I2C communication which means we will be using the SDA/SCL pins on the RPi to set up the connection. The RPi pinout is shown below for reference:

In our case, we need the first two and the last two pins. The sensor requires only 3V to run, but has regulators on board that can handle 5V. We must also use pull-up resistors on the SDA and SCL pins as it is good practice. The connection schematic is shown below:

## Installing Necessary Packages
In order to use the TSL2591 sensor, we have to enable the I2C communication protocol. From the command line on the RPi:
1. Type ```$ raspi-config```
2. Choose ```Interfacing Options```
3. Navigate to ```P5 I2C```
4. When prompted, select ```<YES>```. 

Now that I2C has been configured, install the following python libraries:

### Circuit Python
General circuit-python library which will allow easy interfacing with Adafruti devices
```
$ pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-lis3dh
```

### TSL2591
The library to read data from the sensor
```
$ pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tsl2591
```

With this library, you can measure the following:
- **lux**: Computed light lux value
- **visible**: Visible light level measured by the sensor as a 32-bit unsigned value with no units, where the higher the number the more visible light.
- **infrared**: Infrared light level measured by the sensor as a 16-bit unsigned value with no units, where the higher the number the more infrared light.
- **full_spectrum**: Visible & infrared light level measured by the sensor as a single 32-bit value with no units, where the higher the number the more full spectrum light.
- **raw_luminosity**: A 2-tuple of raw sensor visible+IR and IR only light levels. Each is a 16-bit value with no units where the higher the value the more light.


## Testing the Sensor

Sample code can be found in the [Sample Code](Sample_Code/) directory. There is one files there: [Data Logging Code](Sample_Code/tsl2591_datalogger.py) - code that runs indefinitely and logs data in a csv file
