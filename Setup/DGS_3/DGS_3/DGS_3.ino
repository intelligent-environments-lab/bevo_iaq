/*
  ULP - Library for reading SPEC Sensors ULP.
  Created by David E. Peaslee, OCT 27, 2017.
  Released into the SPEC Sensors domain.
*/

/* The library is built to use several SPEC ULP sensors. An Arduino Uno can handle 3 sensors, since 2 analog pins are required for each sensor.
  Functions include getTemp(seconds, C/F): returns temperature, setTSpan(seconds, "HIGH"/"LOW"): for calibrating temperature, setVref(R1,R2,R3) for custom sensors,
  getVgas(seconds): for getting voltage of sensor, getConc(seconds, temperature in degC): for getting temperature corrected concentration,
  setXSpan(): for setting the calibration factor with known concentration of gas. Variable include _Vcc: the voltage ref of the ADC, _Vsup: the voltage to the ULP, 
  and _Gain the value of resistor R6. For more details see ULP.cpp in the libraries folder and the data sheet at http://www.spec-sensors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Analog-SDK-Users-Manual-v18.pdf
*/  

/* As an example, the ULP is connected this way: Vgas (pin1) to A0, Vtemp (Pin3) to A3, Gnd (Pin6) to Gnd, V+ (Pin7 or Pin8) to 3.3V of Arduino (must not be above 3.3V!!!).*/

// O3
const int C2 = A1;
const int T2 = A4;
// SO2
//const int C3 = A2;
//const int T3 = A5;
